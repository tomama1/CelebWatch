We want to create a platform for people to be able to connect with their favorite celebrities on one website using the Instagram API and Twitter API.

Users will first have to signup by creating a login and accepting a contract to not use the website for illegal purposes. They will then be able to search a celebrity and be shown recent activity from the celebrity's social networking accounts. They will also be able to post on a forum to chat with other users about their shared interest in their favorite celebrities.

Admins update the celebrity database and moderate forums for any inappropriate actions.
